GITIGNORE FILE - VERSION 5.0 (Will be updated each version parallel)
PROJECT: BASIC++ (IB) INTERPRETER
======================================================================

Preamble:
This document constitutes a formal .gitignore specification. Its
purpose is to enumerate file and directory patterns that the Git
version control system is instructed to disregard. The primary
objective is to ensure the integrity of the source code repository
by proscribing the inclusion of generated, user-specific, or
ephemeral binary files.

Adherence to this specification is essential for maintaining a
pristine, replicable source tree. It prevents the contamination
of the commit history with transient artifacts, reduces the
aggregate size of the repository, and mitigates the risk of
non-deterministic merge conflicts arising from generated files.

======================================================================
Section 1: Project-Specific Runtime Artifacts
======================================================================

This section enumerates file patterns that are direct, dynamic
outputs generated by the interpreter's own custom directives
during its operation. Such files are considered ephemeral runtime
artifacts, not constituent components of the source code.
Their inclusion in version control is proscribed, as they represent
transient data, would introduce non-determinism, and would
pollute the commit history.

Generated by the LPRINT directive; this file simulates a
physical line printer and is a runtime data sink.

lprint.out

Compiled project binaries. These are the final, platform-specific
executables produced by the compiler from the source code. As
generated artifacts, they must be excluded.

ib
ib.exe

======================================================================
Section 2: C/C++ Compilation and Build Artifacts (Expanded)
======================================================================

This section is a comprehensive amalgamation based on the standard
GitHub C/C++ template, augmented with additional common build
outputs. It addresses the intermediate and final products of the
compilation and linking lifecycle.

Prerequisites and dependency files.
Generated by compiler pre-processors (e.g., gcc -M) to
track header file dependencies for incremental compilation.

*.d

Object files.
These files represent the intermediate, unlinked, compiled
output of individual translation units (source files).

*.o
*.ko
*.obj
*.elf

Linker output files.
Generated during the final linking phase, these files contain
symbolic information, memory maps, or exportation data.

*.ilk
*.map
*.exp

Precompiled Headers (PCH).
Binary caches of header files utilized by compilers (e.g., GCC,
Clang, MSVC) to accelerate subsequent compilation cycles.

*.gch
*.pch

Static Libraries.

Archived collections of object files (e.g., .a, .lib)
used by the linker to build the final executable.
Also includes intermediate files from libtool (.la, .lo).

*.lib
*.a
*.la
*.lo

Dynamic Libraries (Shared Objects).
These are runtime, not compile-time, dependencies. They are
loaded by the operating system (e.g., .dll, .so, .dylib)
and are not part of the source tree.

*.dll
*.so
.so.
*.dylib

Executable Binaries.
General patterns for final program binaries across various
operating systems and architectures. The 'ib' and 'ib.exe'
patterns are explicitly defined in Section 1. 'a.out' is the
default executable name on POSIX systems.

*.exe
*.out
*.app
.i86
*.x86_64
*.hex

Debugging Files.
Files containing symbolic data for debuggers (e.g., GDB, LLDB,
MSVC Debugger) or other profiling tools.

*.dSYM/
*.su
*.idb
*.pdb
*.gdb
*.sym

Kernel Module Compilation Results.
Artifacts specific to the development of Linux kernel modules.

.mod
*.cmd
.tmp_versions/
modules.order
Module.symvers
Mkfile.old
dkms.conf

Debug Information Files.
DWARF object files (Debug With Arbitrary Record Format),
a common format for debugging data.

*.dwo

Section 3: Build System Artifacts

======================================================================

This section specifies files and directories generated by
automation systems such as Make, CMake, and Autotools. These
files are invariably machine-generated and specific to a single
build environment.

General build output directories.
Common names for directories containing all compiled artifacts.

build/
bin/
dist/
release/
debug/

CMake (Cross-platform Make) build artifacts.
These files constitute the cache, makefiles, and project
configurations generated by CMake.

CMakeCache.txt
CMakeFiles/
cmake_install.cmake
Makefile
CTestTestfile.cmake

GNU Autotools generated files.
The Autotools suite (Autoconf, Automake) generates these
configuration scripts and build files from templates.

autom4te.cache/
configure
config.status
config.log
config.h
aclocal.m4
stamp-h1

Makefile artifacts.
Files generated for or by the Make utility.

Makefile.in

======================================================================
Section 4: Testing, Profiling, and Coverage Reports
======================================================================

This section enumerates data files and reports generated by
software quality assurance tools, including unit testing
frameworks, code coverage utilities (e.g., gcov, lcov), and
memory analysis tools (e.g., Valgrind).

Gcov / LCOV code coverage data.
These files contain execution counts and report data.

*.gcno
*.gcda
*.gcov
*.lcov
lcov.info
coverage.xml
coverage/

Valgrind memory analysis reports.
Output files from various Valgrind tools (Memcheck,
Callgrind, Helgrind, Massif).

valgrind-out.txt
callgrind.out.*
helgrind-out.*
massif.out.*

======================================================================
Section 5: Operating System-Specific Metadata
======================================================================

This section proscribes system-generated metadata files. These
files are created by the operating system itself to manage
folder views, indexing, or trash receptacles, and have no
relevance to the project's source code.

macOS
Files for the Finder, Spotlight, and resource forks.

.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
__MACOSX/

Windows
Files for Explorer thumbnail caches, desktop configuration,
the recycle bin, and shortcut links.

Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
desktop.ini
$RECYCLE.BIN/
*.lnk

Linux
Common patterns for backup files, directory metadata,
and trash folders.

~
.directory

======================================================================
Section 6: Editor and IDE Configuration Files
======================================================================

This section specifies user-specific configuration, cache, and
state files generated by Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs) and text editors. These files are highly specific to an
individual developer's local environment and must be excluded.

General backup/swap files
Temporary or backup files created by editors like Vim or Emacs.

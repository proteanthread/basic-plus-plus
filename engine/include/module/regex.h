/**
 * @file regex.h
 * @brief Module component implementation and public API surface for regex.h.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES:
 * Implements the core responsibilities, data structures, and function evaluation logic for regex.h within the module subsystem.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 * Ensures decoupled modularity, strict C17 portability, and clear micro-library architectural boundary enforcement.
 *
 * WHY IT WORKS THIS WAY:
 * Designed with zero-initialization defaults, bounded memory operations, and explicit error code propagation to the VM state.
 *
 * WHAT CAN BE CHANGED:
 * Subsystem configuration defaults, local execution helper routines, and documentation annotations.
 *
 * WHAT CANNOT BE CHANGED:
 * Public API symbol declarations, micro-library metadata structures, and thread-safe error reporting contracts.
 *
 * WHAT TO EXPECT:
 * High-performance deterministic execution with zero side-effects outside designated state structures.
 *
 * WHAT TO DO IF SOMETHING BREAKS:
 * Verify context initialization, trace BppError return codes, and inspect log outputs for bounds assertions.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS:
 * Valid subsystem contexts and required memory pools are allocated prior to executing API handlers.
 *
 * PORTABILITY CONCERNS:
 * Strict C17 compliance, 64-bit pointer safety, and pure ASCII string operations across desktop, IoT, and embedded targets.
 *
 * FUTURE EXPANSIONS:
 * Additional dialect compatibility mappings, telemetry instrumentation, and microcontroller payload stubs.
